****SMS Spam Detection****

*Overview
******************************************************************
This project focuses on building an SMS spam detection model using machine learning techniques. The model classifies text messages as either spam or ham (not spam) based on their content. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a classification model to identify spam messages effectively.

Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled SMS messages, typically sourced from open datasets like the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. It contains:

Spam messages: Unsolicited promotional or fraudulent messages.

Ham messages: Normal, non-spam messages.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

NLTK, re (Regular Expressions) (for text preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

Flask (optional) (for deploying the model as an API)

Installation
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git
cd sms-spam-detection

2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
ython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`




usages
1.Train the Model:
   python src/model.py
2.Make Predictions:

python src/predict.py "Your message here"

Model Performance

The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results may vary depending on feature engineering and the choice of classifier.
Future Enhancements
*Improve preprocessing for better feature extraction.

Experiment with deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers).

Deploy the model as a web application or API.
